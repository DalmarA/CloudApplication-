            <h1><strong>What Is Cloud Applications</strong></h1>
            <p>A cloud app is an application that operates in the cloud. Cloud apps are considered to be a blend of standard Web applications and conventional desktop applications. </p>

            <h1><strong>Servers Vs Clients</strong></h1>
            <br>
            <p>Servers are powerful computers dedicated to managing file servers , print Servers, or serving up resource for clients. Servers are usually headless meaning there are no peripheral devices, this is done to lower electricity consumption because servers are usually on 24/7. Clients are PC, laptops and mobile devices which users run applications and rely on servers for resources, such as files, devices, media, and even processing power.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="slide3" class="step slide" data-x="500" data-y="-5700">
            <h1><strong>Commercial Cloud Applications</strong></h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>Netflix <br> <br> Netflix Inc. is an international provider of on-demand Internet streaming media (Series and Movies). <br> <br> Dropbox <br> <br> Dropbox is a on-demand File service allowing you to store your data online.<br> <br> SoundCloud <br> <br> SoundCloud is a music Cloud streaming application </p>

        <div id="slide9" class="step slide" data-x="500" data-y="-5000">
            <h1><strong>Self-Hosting Cloud Application</strong></h1>
            <h1><strong>Own Cloud</strong></h1>
            <p>Is a Cloud App that allows people to host their own cloud solution with their own equipment and internet connect. This is useful for people who don't wat to pay a monthly fee.</p>
            <h1><strong>Sonarr</strong></h1>
            <p>This is a cloud application used to automatically tracks, downloads and sorts tv shows with the use of Usenet Groups and/or Torrents after the series is added from the Web UI or compatible Browser Extensions.</p>
            <h1><strong>Counch Potato</strong></h1>
            <p>Is a cloud application that automatically tracks, downloads and sorts Movies with the use of Usenet Groups and/or Torrents when they have been tagged with the IMDB browser extension or from the Web UI.</p>
            <h1><strong>Headphones</strong></h1>
            <p>Is a cloud application that automatically tracks, downloads and sorts music of artists added to the database from either Usenet or Torrent.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="slide10" class="step slide" data-x="500" data-y="-4300">
            <h1><strong>Media Servers</strong></h1>
            <p>Unlike Own Cloud, Sonarr, Couch Potato and Headphones doesnâ€™t allow viewing of the downloaded files over the web panel so if someone were to take up this project they would need a media server to add the cloud capabilities with some security so as long as your server has an internet connection at home you can stream your content to device with access to the internet, so you can watch a movie on your phone in the subway just as you would at home all with out paying any monthly fees.</p>
            <h1><strong>Emby</strong></h1>
            This is a very feature packed free open source media server which also allows casting to UPNP/DLNA devices and chrome cast, roku, etc.
            <h1><strong>Plex</strong></h1>
            <p>This is application is older and has more users but in order to view content on your server you would need an Plex app or view as network file system on the client.</p>
<!-- 
        <div id="slide11" class="step slide" data-x="500" data-y="-3600">
            <h1><strong>IOT Solutions for playback of content</strong></h1>
            <p>these would work better with Emby becaue the Web app has support for playback on network devices you dont need extra software to communicate with these device,plex wouldnt work because it requries a app on its clients.</p>
            <h1><strong>Comercial Device</strong></h1>
            <p>Chromecast<br>Chromecast Audio<br>Apple TV</p>
            <h1><strong>DIY Solutions</strong></h1>
            <p>For an DIY project you can use any microproccessor that can run OS needed, for example I have a similar media server setup with and Odroid U3 and a raspberry pi running musicbox.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Raspberry Pi + Musicbox = IOT Audio streaming over network <br>Raspberry Pi + XBMC = IOT Media streamer (Movies, Series, Music)<br>Raspberry Pi + Rasplex = IOT Plex Client (Movies, Series, Music)(Only streams Plex content)</p>
